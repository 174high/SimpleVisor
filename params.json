  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nSimpleVisor can be built with any recent copy of Visual Studio 2015. Other compilers have not been tested and are not supported.\r\nIt has currently been tested on the following platforms succesfully:\r\n\r\n* Windows 8.1 on a Haswell Processor\r\n* Windows 10 Redstone 1 on a Sandy Bridge Processor\r\n* Windows 10 Threshold 2 on a Skylake Processor\r\n\r\nNote that x86 versions of Windows are expressly not supported, nor are processors earlier than the Nehalem microarchitecture.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nToo many hypervisor projects out there are either extremely complicated ([Xen][1], KVM, VirtualBox) and/or closed-source (VMware, Hyper-V), as well as heavily focused toward Linux-based development or system. Additionally, most (other than Hyper-V) of them are expressly built for the purpose of enabling the execution of virtual machines, and not the virtualization of a live, running system, in order to perform introspection or other security-related tasks on it.\r\n\r\nA few projects do stand out from the fold however, such as the original [Blue Pill][2] from Johanna, or projects such as [VirtDbg][3] and [HyperDbg][4]. Unfortunately, most of these have become quite old by now, and some only function on x86 processors, and don't support newer operating systems such as Windows 10.\r\n\r\nThe closest project that actually delivers a Windows-centric, modern, and supported hypervisor is [HyperPlatform][5], and the author strongly recommends its use as a starting place for commercial and/or production-worthy hypervisor development. However, in attempting to create a generic \"platform\" that can be productized, HyperPlatform also suffers from a bit of bloat, making it harder to understand what truly are the basic needs of a hypervisor, and how to initialize one.\r\n\r\nThe express goal of this project, as stated above, was to minimize code in any way possible, without causing negative side-effects, and focusing on the 'bare-metal' needs. This includes:\r\n\r\n* Minimizing use of assembly code. If it weren't for the lack of an __lgdt intrinsic, and a workaround for the behavior of a Windows API, only the first 4 instructions of the hypervisor's entry point would require assembly. As it stands, the project has a total of 10 instructions, spread throughout 3 functions. This is a maassive departure from other hypervisor projects, which often have multiple hundreds of line of assembly code. A variety of Windows-specific and compiler-specific tricks are used to achieve this, which will be described in the source code.\r\n* Reducing checks for errors which are unlikely to happen. Given a properly configured, and trusted, set of input data, instructions such as vmx_vmwrite and vmx_vmread should never fail, for example.\r\n* Removing support for x86, which complicates matters and causes special handling around 64-bit fields.\r\n* Expressely reducing all possible VM-Exits to only the Intel architecturally defined minimum (CPUID, INVD, VMX Instructions, and XSETBV). This is purposefully done to keep the hypervisor as small as possible, as well as the initialization code.\r\n* No support for VMCALL. Many hypervisors use VMCALL as a way to exit the hypervisor, which requires assembly programming (there is no intrinsic) and additional exit handling. SimpleVisor uses a CPUID trap instead.\r\n* Relying on little-known Windows functions to simplify development of the hypervisor, such as Generic DPCs and hibernation contexts.\r\n\r\nAnother implied goal was to support the very latest in hardware features, as even [Bochs][6] doesn't always have the very-latest Intel VMX instructions and/or definitions. These are often found in header files such as \"vmcs.h\" and \"vmx.h\" that various projects have at various levels of definition. For example, Xen master has some unreleased VM Exit reasons, but not certain released ones, which Bochs does have, albeit it doesn't have the unreleased ones!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can setup the required entries for SimpleVisor in the registry with the following command:\r\n\r\n```sc create simplevisor type= kernel binPath= \"<PATH_TO_SIMPLEVISOR.SYS>\"```\r\n\r\nYou can then launch SimpleVisor with\r\n\r\n```net start simplevisor```\r\n\r\nAnd stop it with\r\n\r\n```net stop simplevisor```\r\n\r\nYou must have administrative rights for usage of any of these commands.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/upring/virtdbg\r\n\r\nhttp://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=summary\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/svn2github/bochs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rmusser01/hyperdbg\r\n\r\nhttp://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh07/nbp-0.32-public.zip\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform\r\n\r\n[3]:https://github.com/upring/virtdbg\r\n[1]:http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=summary \"Xen\"\r\n[6]:https://github.com/svn2github/bochs\r\n[4]:https://github.com/rmusser01/hyperdbg\r\n[2]:http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh07/nbp-0.32-public.zip\r\n[5]:https://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2016 Alex Ionescu.
